        <h1 align="center">Things to do in Greece!</h1>
        <p class="indextext">Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean
            and Ionian seas. Influential in ancient times, it's often called the cradle of Western civilization. Athens,
            its capital, retains landmarks including the 5th-century B.C. Acropolis citadel with the Parthenon temple.
            Greece is also known for its beaches, from the black sands of Santorini to the party resorts of Mykonos</P>

        <h2 align="center">Acropolis, Athens</h2>

            alt="Greece" style="width:50%">

        <p class="indextext">The Acropolis is one of the world's most breathtaking ancient ruins, and the city's
            exceptional museums display fascinating artifacts uncovered at local sites. Other hidden charms awaiting
            discovery are the dazzling Byzantine churches found all over the city and the village-like neighborhoods
            north of the Acropolis. When you think you've run out of things to do in Athens, spend some time getting
            lost in the Plaka district's narrow pedestrian streets, lined with quaint bougainvillea-draped houses and
            inviting restaurant terraces.</p>

        <h2 align="center">Santorini</h2>

            alt="Santorini style=" width:50%>

        <p class="indextext">Stunning Santorini is the most dramatic of all the Greek isles. It is best known for the
            west coast cliff-top towns of Fira and Oia, which appear to hang over a deep, blue sea-filled caldera. Made
            up of typical Cycladic whitewashed cubic buildings, many of which have been converted into boutique hotels
            with infinity pools, both Fira and Oia are considered romantic destinations, popular for weddings and
            honeymoons.

            Things to do in Santorini include sunbathing and swimming at the black volcanic-sand beaches on the south
            and east coasts and visiting the archaeological site of Akrobodyclass, an Ancient Minoan settlement buried
            below lava following the volcanic eruption that created the caldera, some 3,600 years ago. The island has an
            airport and is served by ferries and catamarans from Athens' port, Piraeus

            If there are 1000 things to do before you die, having a sundowner overlooking the crater of Santorini would
            near the top of the list. Most places facing the crater are great, but Ouia at the western tip is especially
            popular. While you are on the island, check out the best beaches on Santorini, and great alternative things
            to do on this sometimes crowded island.</p>

            alt="Epidaurus" style="width:50%">

        <p class="indextext">Epidaurus is also one of the best place to visit in Greece. Along with Mycenae, it’s one of
            the two major archaeological sites of Peloponnese and the Argolid region. Epidaurus is also a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site.
            The place is well-known for its ancient theater, built in the 4th century BC. Incredibly well preserved, the
            Epidaurus theatre could accommodate up to 14,000 people.
            With its amazing acoustic, the theater is still used today for antique Greek plays representations during
            the Epidaurus Festival (in July and August).

            The sanctuary also includes a temple dedicated to the god of medicine Asclepios, a circular building named
            the tholos, a stadium and a small archaeological museum. There, you can see some of the statues discovered
            on the site and in the surrounding area.</p>

            alt="Greece" style="width:50%">

        <p class="indextext">Also located in the Peloponnese, Olympia Archaeological Site is a must-see attraction in
            Greece.

            Olympia is known to be the birthplace of the Ancient Olympic Games. They were organized on this site every 4
            years from 776 B.C to 393 A.D, before being forbidden. Nowadays, the Lightning Ceremony of the Olympic flame
            takes place in Olympia before every opening of the Modern Olympic Games.
            On the ancient site, you will see the ruins of Temples dedicated to the Greek Gods Zeus and Hera, as well as
            sporting facilities such as the stadium and the gymnasium.
            It might takes you a lot of imagination to picture what monuments used to look like, but luckily, you will
            find many explanatory signs on the site.
            If you want to learn more about Olympia, you definitely have to visit the Olympia Archaeological Museum. The
            best is to do it before visiting the Archaeological Site.</p>
